## Portfolio Project Plan: for HARARMAGALA


Team Members:

Only one: Mahbub Mohammed

 Developer: Backend as well as frontend



Objective:


The portfolio project aims to create an e-commerce website that helps leverage the sale and business of Harari traditional items, including mots, head coverings, wall decorations, and traditional foods, promoting cultural heritage and supporting local artisans.

Technology Stack:


Backend:

Language: Python

 Database: SQLite

 Frameworks: Django, SQL, ORM

 Libraries: Django web service, integrated with PostgreSQL



Frontend:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

 Platforms: WebStorm, VS Code

 Frameworks: Bootstrap, Flexbox

 Libraries: jQuery (optional for enhanced interactivity)



Technology Trade-offs:

Backend: Python was chosen over Node.js because it is a more mature and widely-used language with a large community and ecosystem, offering robust support for e-commerce functionality.

 Frontend: HTML and CSS were selected over React and Angular because they are simpler and more approachable, making them ideal for a beginner project while still delivering a functional user interface.



Challenge:

Problem: The portfolio project is intended to build an e-commerce website that helps leverage the sale and business of Harari traditional items. It aims to make it easier for customers to search, find, and process payment and delivery with a seamless experience, requiring less time and effort.

 Non-solutions: The portfolio project will not address the sourcing or production of Harari traditional items.

 Users: The portfolio project will serve customers and business owners looking to purchase Harari traditional items for personal use, cultural appreciation, or resale.

 Locale: The project's relevance is not strictly tied to a specific locale, as the core functionalities can be adapted for various global marketplaces, though it has a cultural focus on Harari traditions.



Risks:

Technical Risks:
The database could become overloaded with data due to high traffic or large product catalogs.

 The web application could be vulnerable to hacking attempts.

 The web application could experience downtime, disrupting user access.




 Non-technical Risks:
The project could be delayed or canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.

 The project could fail to resonate with users or meet their expectations.

 Difficulty in conveying the cultural value and authenticity of Harari items to users or institutions.




 Safeguards:
The database will be scaled to handle large amounts of data as the platform grows.

 The web application will be secured with industry-standard security measures, such as encryption and secure authentication.

 The web application will be monitored for uptime and performance to ensure reliability.

 The project will follow a detailed project plan to minimize delays and ensure alignment with user needs.






Infrastructure:

Branching and Merging: The team will use the Git Flow branching model to manage code development.

 Deployment: The web application will be deployed to a cloud hosting provider for scalability and accessibility.

 Data Population: The web application will be populated with data from a CSV file containing details of Harari traditional items.

 Testing: The web application will be tested using unit tests and integration tests to ensure functionality and performance.



Existing Solutions:

Similar Products:
Websites of cultural retailers or artisan marketplaces (e.g., Etsy for handmade goods or specialized regional craft sites).




 Similarities and Differences:
Similar to platforms like Etsy, this project focuses on selling culturally significant items but is tailored specifically to Harari traditions rather than a broad handmade goods marketplace.

 Unlike some desktop-based artisan management tools, this project is a fully web-based e-commerce solution.




 Reimplementation:
The portfolio project is not a reimplementation of an existing proven solution but a unique platform designed to promote Harari cultural items.
